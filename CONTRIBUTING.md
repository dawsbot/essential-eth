#### What is a GitPOAP?

GitPOAP is a contributor recognition platform built on top of the POAP Protocol (Proof of Attendance Protocol). Similar to a POAP, each GitPOAP represents a digital collectible. It serves as a badge of validation for the action taken by the individual. By serving as a bridge between Github and Web3, it allows repo maintainers to recognize contributors for their meaningful contributions. Learn more about GitPOAP, [here](https://www.gitpoap.io/).

#### How can I claim?

Here are two steps that you can take to qualify for a GitPOAP:

1. Contribute to [any open issue](https://github.com/dawsbot/essential-eth/issues) and submit a PR. Upon approval of PR merge, the GitPOAP will automatically be issued to the Github account. 🤝👩‍💻👨‍💻

2. Head to gitpoap.io and connect your GitHub account to mint! 💰🔗
