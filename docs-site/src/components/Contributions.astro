      <h3>GitPOAP - Recognition for Contributions</h3>
      <p>
        In partnership with GitPOAP, Essential ETH wants to recognize
        <strong>all</strong> contributors for their contributions toward the growth
        of this library. Developers can validate their contributions on Github
        and showcase their GitPOAP as proof-of-work toward their Web3 identity.
